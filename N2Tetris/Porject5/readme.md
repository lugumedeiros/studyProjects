Honestly, this project was terrible for me...


Until now I had no problems to understanding what was going on, everything was simple. But this project was like a brick in the face, from the start I was struggling to understand. I'm not
saying that the project was bad our the video or documents are bad, just saying that I had difficulties. My main point was not seeing the big picture and I guess that this is due to inexperience.

I was able to finish and understand this project by watching Tea Leaves tutorials on youtube, he made an entire playlist doing part one of Nand2Tetris. With his videos and the visuals of digital(logism alike) I was able to basically copy from him, and I'm sad because of it.
 What I feel is that we had so much hand-helding that in the moment it let us go, it was worse than just not helping from the start.
