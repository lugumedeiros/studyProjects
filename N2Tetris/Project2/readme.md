This is the second project.
It was pretty easy to be honest, most of this stuff I already knew beforehand. The biggest challenge was to use the course HDL program, it's very hard to debug with it as some errors are not due to a mistake itself, but for a illegal operation
that could happen in a real cpu. Any way, this was a fun little challenge.
