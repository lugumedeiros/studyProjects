## V1 - PTH Version
This was the first version I made from a course I was watching on Udemy, it's very similar to the one created by the teacher and it has only PTH components.

This version uses a simple LDO to 5V, NPN Amplifier and a 555 Generic Counter. It has a 9V battery package slot but it can be used any other battery over 5V, it will mainly depend on the LDO properties.

## V2 - SMD
This is the final stage of my current SMD version I want to send to production. This version doesn't have a LDO due to being made for a CR2032 battery, the 555 counter was changed to a CMOS one for the low voltage supplied.

The new format is made to be "assembled" as a puzzle piece with the other 2 versions that have different frequencies.

This is an older version, but has the same concept

## V3 - SMD
This is almost the same as the V2, but with bigger packages for easier manual soldering. Assembly is hella expensive :(
