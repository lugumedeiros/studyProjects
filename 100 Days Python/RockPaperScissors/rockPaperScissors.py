''' The idea of this program is to calculate a rock, paper and scissors based in a simple calculation of 
(user_hand_id) - (cpu_hand_id), where scissors(1), paper(2) and rock(3). The result of such calculation
will be a Draw if equals to ZERO or (user_hand_id == cpu_hand_id).
For user winning hand the result must be 2(paper - rock) or -1(scissors - paper; paper - rock).
Everything else (-2, 1) is a win hand for CPU.'''
