I made this program for a little course I'm doing, it was a pretty good exercise were was asked for
a program that gives a calendar based on 2 inputs, year and first day of the week of the year.
Well, I searched a bit and found some websites that have old calendars like year 1 and for my
surprise, it was wrong. So based on a little formula for leap years and using the calendar of 2023
I remade the formula to give the exactly first day of the week of any year by adjusting the offset 
using 2023 as base.
It works even for BC years!!
Year 0 and year -1 are the exactly same in this program (year 0 doesn't exist)
